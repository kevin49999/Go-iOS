/// https://www.britgo.org/intro/intro2.html
/// http://cjlarose.com/2014/01/09/react-board-game-tutorial.html - good ref!
/// need concept of strings/groups and their surroundings
/// need end game concept (PASSING stones aka skipping your turn - 2 stones on bottom that are disabled/enabled until turned on, one person plays, undos passed stone
/// need blocking of self capture -> emoji with flashing tint?? like waveman sprite animation.. (do alpha fading fast 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0)
/// need redo move as well? er

/// LATER
/// add mention of atari?
/// need handicap placement of stones automatically
