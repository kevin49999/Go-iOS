## Ideas

- [ ] Save previous games for later study and walkthrough
- [ ] Localize in Chinese and other languages
- [ ] Better zoom and features (ex: hold + drag to place stone) for playing a large board game on a small phone
- [ ] Game Center setup for networked games
- [ ] Improve design/board backgrounds (wood, marble, etc.)

## Installation
