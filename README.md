# Go-iOS

Play the ancient Chinese game of Go on your iPhone/iPad :iphone:

## Contributing

Anyone is welcome to contribute! I am not the most knowledgeable Go player, so I'm sure there are holes to file in. There are also ideas for features to build below :sunglasses:

## TODOs / Feature Ideas
- [ ] Save previous games for later study and walkthrough
- [ ] Localize in Chinese and other languages
- [ ] Better zoom, and features (ex: hold + drag to place stone) for playing a large board game on a small phone
- [ ] Play against a computer with varying skill level :robot:
- [ ] Improve design/board backgrounds (wood, marble, etc.)

### Accessibility
- [ ] VoiceOver :star:
- [ ] Reduce motion
- [ ] Haptic feedback off/on
- [ ] Invert colors
- [ ] + more

## Why

- Have a blank app to implement Accessibility features I/we have not done before
- Fresh app to implement what's new in iOS 13 (Swift UI, Dark Mode, etc.)
- Setup/configure CI from beginning of a project
- To have fun, learn from others :balloon:
